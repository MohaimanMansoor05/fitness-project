        <h1>What is GYM Nutrition ?</h1>
        <p>Nutrition plays a crucial role in fitness and bodybuilding, <br>acting as the fuel that powers workouts and supports recovery. <br>Whether aiming for strength, endurance, or fat loss, a tailored diet helps meet these goals more efficiently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="start">
        <h1>Macronutrients And Their Role in Fitness</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="proteins">
        <h2>PROTEINS</h2>
        <img class="image1" src="./proteins1.jpg" alt="prot1">
        <p class="para1">Proteins are made up of amino acids, which repair muscle fibers <br> that break down during exercise, thus supporting muscle growth.</p>
        <p class="para2">Sources of Protein: Include lean meats (chicken, turkey), fish, eggs, dairy (yogurt, milk), <br> and plant-based proteins like lentils, beans, and tofu for vegetarians.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="carbohydrate">
        <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
        <img class="image2" src="./carbohydrates-food-sources-top-view-on-a-table-2BW6KWY.jpg" alt="carb1">
        <p><b>Fueling Your Workout:</b> Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy, stored as glycogen <br> in muscles, which powers the body during intense workouts. <br>
            <br> <b>Good Carbs vs. Bad Carbs:</b> Explain complex carbohydrates (whole grains, oats, sweet potatoes) <br> that provide lasting energy vs. simple sugars that can lead to energy crashes</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fats">
        <h2>Fats</h2>
        <img class="image3" src="./fats-1.avif" alt="fta1">
        <p> <b>Healthy Fats and Their Importance:</b> Fats are essential for hormone production, including testosterone, <br> which supports muscle growth and recovery.
            <b>Sources of Healthy Fats:</b> Avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish (like salmon) <br> are excellent sources of unsaturated fats that can support heart health and brain function</p>
    </div>

    <div class="supplement">
        <h2>Supplements for Gym Nutrition</h2>
        <img class="image4" src="./powder.jpg" alt="sip1">
        <p> <b> Protein Powder:</b> Provides a convenient way to meet daily protein needs. Types include <br>whey (fast-digesting), casein (slow-digesting),  and plant-based (pea, rice) options.
          <br> <br>  <b> Creatine: </b>Enhances strength and muscle mass by supporting ATP production, <br> which powers short bursts of high-intensity activity</p>
